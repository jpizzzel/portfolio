# portfolio

This is website that you are currently on! I made this in the summer of 2024 to showcase different projects from my past and projects I am currently working on.
I also wanted to display my website design, three.js, javascript and 3D design skills through a portfolio site. I am not quite sure how else I want to add to this 
site currently but I know in the future I want to continue to improve this site and experiment with new technologies I come across.
