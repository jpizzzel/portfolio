## Notes

- The **wave doodle SVG** and **mountain/wave divider SVGs** are hand-coded as inline SVG in the components — no image assets needed.
- The **squiggle underline SVG** for nav active states is also inline SVG — no image asset needed.
- All textures are used at very low opacity (3-5%) so they should be subtle, not heavy-handed.
- For the hero illustration, watercolor/ink sketch style works best. Avoid photorealistic or 3D renders.
